I received M.Sc. degree in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University, supervised by tenured Asso. Prof. [Yinliang Xu](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xyl/main.htm). Meanwhile, I’m a member of Energy Management System Laboratory led by Prof. [Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/shb.htm) (*IEEE Fellow*, *Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences*), Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University. Before that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at South China University of Technology. Now, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Yan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZAhePQ4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who was under the supervision of Prof. [Zhaoyang Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7FORgWsAAAAJ&hl=en) (*IEEE Fellow*).

My research interests include time series probability prediction methods in power systems and optimization theory, optimal operation control and robust optimization of microgrids, as well as the application of AI/LLM in power systems and integrated energy systems.
